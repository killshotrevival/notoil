## NoToil

```
Toil is not just “work I don’t like to do.” It’s also not simply equivalent to administra‐

Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that
tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows.
